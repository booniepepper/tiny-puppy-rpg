This is a game made in 2010 for some kind of alternate history game jam. 13 years later, I've forgotten some of the details. I made it under the pretense that it's an alternate history where _you_ are the puppy.

The original (weird) devlog: https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=14663.0

I'm also using this as an example to demonstrate how to host old flash games on itch.io. Hopefully this is helpful to other game devs with older projects.

It's also possible to download the `tiny-puppy-rpg.swf` file and run with Ruffle
